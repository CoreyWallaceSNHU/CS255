**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
DriverPass was the main client. The goal of DriverPass was to solve the problem of inadequate driving instruction. This project's goal was to improve driver education by using live teaching and online courses.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I was able to create better diagrams and understand the flow of them. The diagrams were easy to read and got to the point.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I think that I need to improve on my class diagram. I can never understand if I am doing it correctly and if I am putting enough information on them.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
From the start, I designed the system with user needs in mind. I made graphics that demonstrated the likely ways in which consumers might engage with them. If user needs are not thoroughly taken into account, the system will not turn out the results that have been requested. Whether it's design or function, the needs must be met to get the desired results.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I approach the designing using the iterative design approach. It helps keep the design on point while also minimizing the impact on the workload. It helps me maintain the timeline and not fall behind.
